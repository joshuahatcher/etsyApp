etsyApp
=======
This was a search application that I created a couple of years ago when I was just starting out working with API calls (ie: when I was just starting to program). I see PLENTY of things I would change now, but I think it was an important marker in the timeline of my career as a developer.

The app lets you search for items in the Etsy database, as well as limit your results. You can remove items from the returned list of results, or go to the product page for each item. The CSS styles were compiled from Sassy CSS (SCSS), and I used a Handlebars template for some of the HTML structure.
